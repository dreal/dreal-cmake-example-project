[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dreal/dreal-cmake-example-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dreal/dreal-cmake-example-project)

An example cmake project to show you how to use the system-installed
dReal as a library in a Cmake project.

Setup
=====

You need to install [dReal4](https://github.com/dreal/dreal4) in your
system. We also rely on
[pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config).

macOS 10.14 / 10.13
-------------------

We use [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```bash
brew install dreal/dreal/dreal
```


Ubuntu 18.04 / 16.04
--------------------

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dreal/dreal4/master/setup/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -r -s)/install.sh | sudo bash
```


CMake Build
===========
